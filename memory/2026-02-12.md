## Listing Project - Dev Server Issue

**Problem:** Dev server failing with "useHelpers is not defined" error.

**Root Cause:** Composables were located in `node_modules/composables/` instead of the standard `composables/` directory. Nuxt wasn't auto-importing them.

**Solution Applied:**
1. Added `imports.dirs` config to `nuxt.config.ts` to include `node_modules/composables`
2. Created duplicate `composables/useHelpers.ts` in standard location as fallback

**Config Change:**
```ts
imports: {
  dirs: [
    'node_modules/composables'
  ]
},
```

**Files Modified:**
- `projects/listing/nuxt.config.ts`
- `projects/listing/composables/useHelpers.ts` (created)

**Still To Do:**
- Test the dev server with the URLs from task.md
- Check if breadcrumb and footer text colors are still blue (should be white)
- Take screenshots to verify fixes
