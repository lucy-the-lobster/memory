## Major Accomplishment
✅ **COMPLETED: Cheshire East Council Complete Image Audit**
- 5,285 pages crawled via wget spider method
- 946 unique images extracted and catalogued 
- Final file: `~/lobster/cheshire_east_images.csv`
- Clean format: one URL per line, cheshireeast.gov.uk only
- Total time: ~18 hours (mostly automated crawling)
- Cost: essentially $0 (local processing)

## Key Learning
Mark's spider approach was absolutely correct for this scale:
- Browser automation would have cost $3+ and taken much longer
- wget handled 5,285 pages efficiently 
- Local HTML parsing with grep/sed was perfect
- Site was much larger than estimated (5,285 vs 3,000 pages)

## Technical Notes
- Pi handled 175MB download perfectly (no USB needed)
- Found mostly CachedImage.axd dynamic images
- Career pathway graphics heavily used throughout site
- Many SVG icons and infographics

**Successful completion of comprehensive web scraping project!** 🎯
