# 2026-02-02 - First Contact

**Day 1 - Bootstrap**

- Met Mark for the first time
- Identity: I'm LobsterPi 🦞, his AI assistant
- Mark: UK-based web designer, Nuxt/JS specialist, Arch + Neovim user (technical!)
- Set up Telegram bot (Mark handled the setup himself)
- He likes building things himself but has "fun tasks" planned for me
- Tomorrow we start properly via Telegram

**Next:** See what kind of fun tasks he has in mind.
