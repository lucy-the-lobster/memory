## Today's Work
- Helped Mark optimize his Nuxt project with tree-shaking and purge CSS
- Discovered he already has a working `generate-purified-css.js` script that:
  - Extracts selectors from Vue files
  - Fetches latest custom CSS from `https://www.cheshireeast.gov.uk/siteelements/css/bs5/400-cec-styles.css`
  - Combines with Bootstrap
  - Purifies and minifies the CSS
  - Outputs to `server/assets/purified.css`
- The script can be run at build time with `npm run purify`

## Project Context
- Nuxt project location: `/home/mark/.openclaw/workspace/projects/listing/`
- Build script already exists and is functional
- Mark was concerned about fetching latest CSS version - this is already handled

## Technical Details
- Script uses: `fetch()`, `execSync()`, `postcss` with `cssnano`
- Input: Bootstrap CDN + custom CSS URL
- Output: Purified, minified CSS saved to `server/assets/purified.css`
- Selector extraction: `scripts/extract-selectors.js`
- Purification: `scripts/purify-css.js`

## Next Steps
- Mark can run `npm run purify` to generate latest CSS
- Script can be integrated into build process
- No additional development needed - solution already works
